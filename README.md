# Introduction

"This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. We also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates."

# Data processing package

To access the data from the CSV, a 'olist' package was created to extract the processed data. It can be installed by accessing the folder and install it via pip.

# Ongoing

I am still working on this projects and updated are mainly done in the Jupyter Notebook. End result should be a simple tableau dashboard for visualizing the findings.
